# AoC-starter
Starter code for Advent of Code for C++

## Prerequisites
Before you start installing things, check what you have:
```shell
> gcc --version
> cmake --version
```

## How to use
You only have to run this once:
```shell
scripts/gen.sh
```

Prepare a problem for a day with:
```shell
scripts/prepare.sh [day_number]
```
This will create a `src/day_X.cpp` file where you will solve problem from day `X`.
It will create a `input/day_X` file where you will manually paste your input that you get in the bottom of problem description.

Run a problem with:
```shell
scripts/run.sh [day_number]
```
